# Smart Plant Care System

The **Smart Plant Care System** is an automated solution designed to help you take better care of your plants. It monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, and alerts you when your plant needs watering through a buzzer that only sounds when you are nearby. The system also features customizable RGB lighting, which you can control using a Rotary Encoder. An LCD screen displays real-time environmental data and serves as the interface for adjusting the light settings.

i didn't find a soil moisture on wokwi.com so i replaced it with a potentiometer. You can remove the potentiometer and put your soil moisture sensor.
